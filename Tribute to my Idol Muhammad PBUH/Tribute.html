  <textarea cols="120" rows='9' id="paragraph"> Islam, unlike many believe is a beautiful and peaceful religion.It is an Arabic word which means "surrender, submission, commitment to God." It is  an Abrahamic monotheistic religion centered around the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad. Islam's five pillars are: the declaration of faith (shahada), prayer (salah), alms-giving (zakat), fasting (sawm) and pilgrimage (hajj). Muslims should believe in the oneness of Allah (God), in the angels, in the holy books (Torah, Bible and Quran) , in all the prophets including Noah , Moses , Jesus.... , in the day of judgment and in the divine decree.They also  believe that the last revealed scripture sent by God is the Qur'an or Koran. It is the speech of God revealed in the Arabic language to Muhammad during his mission of twenty-three years. The Qur'an was written down by scribes and memorized during the lifetime of Muhammad. The Qur'an emphasizes moral, ethical and spiritual values with the aim of establishing justice for everyone.
